Screen Soothe App

Project Objective
Screen Soothe Detox is an app prototype designed to help users reduce their social media usage and develop healthier digital habits. Using Design Thinking principles, the app provides customized detox goals, real-time tracking, and engaging challenges to encourage mindful screen time.


 Design Thinking Process

1️⃣ Empathize & Define
- Conducted user research with 10+ participants.
- Identified common challenges: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), mindless scrolling, lack of motivation.
- Problem Statement: "How might we create an app that empowers users to manage screen time while making them feel accomplished and in control?"

 User Research & Findings 

Surveys & Interviews
I conducted user research with 10+ participants, including young professionals, students, and adults, to understand their social media habits and challenges. Key insights from the research:  

Average screen time:3-5 hours daily.  
Biggest struggles in reducing usage: 
   - Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)  
   - Mindless scrolling out of habit  
   - Lack of motivation to stop  
What users want in a detox app:  
   - Subtle nudges instead of harsh restrictions.    
   - Real-time progress tracking to stay accountable.  


 Empathy Mapping  
Using user feedback, we identified key concerns:  

Thoughts: "I know I spend too much time scrolling, but I don’t want to quit completely."  
Feelings: Guilt, anxiety, and frustration over excessive social media use.  
Says: "I’d use an app if it doesn’t make me feel bad about my habits."  
Does: Mindlessly scroll during free time, checks phone first thing in the morning.
